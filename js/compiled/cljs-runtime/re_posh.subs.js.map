\"For a given `query-id` register a `config` function and input `signals`\n\n  At an abstract level, a call to this function allows you to register 'the mechanism'\n  to later fulfil a call to `(subscribe [query-id ...])`.\n\n  To say that another way, reg-sub allows you to create a template for a node\n  in the signal graph. But note: reg-sub does not cause a node to be created.\n  It simply allows you to register the template from which such a\n  node could be created, if it were needed, sometime later, when the call\n  to `subscribe` is made.\n\n  reg-sub needs three things:\n    - a `query-id`\n    - the required inputs for this node\n    - a function that generates config for query or pull for this node\n\n  The `query-id` is always the 1st argument to reg-sub and it is typically\n  a namespaced keyword.\n\n  A config function is always the last argument and it has this general form:\n  `(input-signals, query-vector) -> a-value`\n\n  What goes in between the 1st and last args can vary, but whatever is there will\n  define the input signals part of the template, and, as a result, it will control\n  what values the config functions gets as a first argument.\n  There's 3 ways this function can be called - 3 ways to supply input signals:\n\n  1. No input signals given:\n\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       a-config-fn)   ;; (fn [db v]  ... a-value)\n     The node's input signal defaults to datascript database, and the value within `ds` is\n     is given as the 1st argument to the computation function.\n\n  2. A signal function is supplied:\n\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       signal-fn     ;; <-- here, the form is (fn [db v] ... signal | [signal])\n       config-fn)\n\n     When a node is created from the template, the `signal-fn` will be called and it\n     is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n     one, or a sequence if there are many.\n     The values from the nominated signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to the\n     config function - either a singleton or sequence, paralleling\n     the structure returned by the signal function.\n     Here, is an example signal-fn, which returns a vector of input signals.\n       (fn [query-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n     For that signal function, the config function must be written\n     to expect a vector of values for its first argument.\n       (fn [[a b] _] ....)\n     If the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n        (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n          (subscribe [:a-sub]))\n     then the config function must be written to expect a single value\n     as the 1st argument:\n        (fn [a _] ...)\n\n  3.

Pairs are supplied instead\n  of an `input signals` functions. Each pair starts with a `:<-` and a subscription\n  vector follows.\n  \"\n  [query-id & args]\n  (let [config-fn  (last args)\n        input-args (butlast args)\n        err-header (str \"re-posh: reg-sub for \" query-id \", \")\n        inputs-fn  (case (count input-args)\n                     ;; no `inputs` function provided - give the default\n                     0 (fn\n                         ([_] nil)\n                         ([_ _] nil))\n\n                     ;; a single `inputs` fn\n                     1 (let [f (first input-args)]\n                         (when-not (fn? f)\n                           (console :error err-header \"2nd argument expected to ba an inputs function, got: \" f))\n                         f)\n\n                     ;; one sugar pair\n                     2 (let [[marker vec] input-args]\n                         (when-not (= :<- marker)\n                           (console :error err-header \"expected :<-, got: \" marker))\n                         (fn inp-fn\n                           ([_] (r/subscribe vec))\n                           ([_ _] (r/subscribe vec))))\n\n                     ;; multiple sugar pairs\n                     (let [pairs (partition 2 input-args)\n                           markers (map first pairs)\n                           vecs (map last pairs)]\n                       (when-not (and (every? #{:<-} markers) (every? vector? vecs))\n                         (console :error err-header \"expected pairs of :<- and vectors, got:\" pairs))\n                       (fn inp-fn\n                         ([_] (map r/subscribe vecs))\n                         ([_ _] (map r/subscribe vecs)))))]\n    (r/reg-sub-raw\n     query-id\n     (fn [_ params]\n       (if (= (count input-args) 0)\n         ;; if there is no inputs-fn provided (or sugar version) don't wrap anything in reaction,\n         ;; just return posh's query or pull\n         (execute-sub (config-fn @@store params))\n         (reaction\n          (let [inputs (inputs-fn params)\n                signals (if (list? inputs)\n                          (map deref inputs)\n                          (deref inputs))]\n            @(execute-sub (config-fn signals params)))))))))\n\n(defn reg-query-sub\n  \"Syntax sugar for writing queries.
